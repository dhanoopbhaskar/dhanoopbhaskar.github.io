<p>This message combines three Microsoft Windows &ldquo;magic tricks&rdquo; that also
circulate individually. The message is often posted to online message
boards and blogs and also circulates via email. According to the
message, not even Microsoft can explain why these procedures invoke such
strange and unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>The procedures outlined are real and do work as described. However,
there is no mystery whatsoever. I discuss each &ldquo;magic&rdquo; item in turn
below:</p>
<p><strong>MAGIC #1</strong></p>
<p>It is in fact perfectly true that you cannot create a folder named
&ldquo;CON&rdquo;, nor can you rename an existing folder to &ldquo;CON&rdquo;. However, the
&ldquo;team&rdquo; at Microsoft, and a great many others besides, know perfectly
well why you cannot name a folder &ldquo;CON&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CON&rdquo; and a number of other character strings are in fact reserved names
that go back to the days of DOS and cannot be used to name folders or
files. Other reserved names are:</p>
<ul>
<li>PRN</li>
<li>AUX</li>
<li>NUL</li>
<li>LPT1</li>
<li>COM1</li>
<li>Potential drive letter - A: to Z:</li>
<li>A number of others</li>
</ul>
<p>If you try to name a folder using one of these reserved names, the name
will automatically revert to the default, generally &ldquo;New Folder&rdquo;.
Moreover, if you try to use a reserved name to name a file such as a
Notepad or Microsoft Word document you will generally receive an error
message similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2011-10-18-microsoft-magic-folder-con.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Depending on exactly how you save the file, you may instead receive a
warning message advising that a file with that name already exists.
However, even if you choose &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to overwrite the existing file, you
will still not be allowed* to save the file.</p>
<p>While there is no mystery about this issue, it might have saved user
confusion if Windows displayed an explanatory error message when
attempting to create a folder with a reserved name as well.</p>
<p>For more detailed information see: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74496/en-us"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MS-DOS Device Driver Names Cannot be Used as File Names</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Note: It may be possible to create a folder using a reserved name via the command
prompt. However, this may cause other problems and is not
advisable.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To create a folder named &ldquo;con&rdquo; - open the command prompt and type</em></p>
<pre><code>md \\.\c:\con
</code></pre>
<p><em>To delete the folder &ldquo;con&rdquo; - type</em></p>
<pre><code>rd \\.\c:\con 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>MAGIC #2</strong></p>
<p>It is true that, when the phrase &ldquo;Bush hid the facts&rdquo; is typed into the
Windows XP or Windows NT/2000 versions of Notepad as instructed above,
the re-opened file displays an unreadable line of squares or Chinese
style characters.</p>
<p>The first image below shows the text before closing the Notepad file.
The second image shows the text as it is displayed after the file is
re-opened:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2011-10-18-microsoft-magic-bush-hid1.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/img/2011-10-18-microsoft-magic-bush-hid2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Some of the more wide-eyed conspiracy theorists postulate that this
result is a form of political commentary directed against US President
Bush.</p>
<p>Alas, the truth is far less compelling. It appears that a lot of other
character strings in the pattern 4 letters, 3 letters, 3 letters and 5
letters will give the same result. For example, the phrase &ldquo;Bill fed the
goats&rdquo; also displays the garbled text as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2011-10-18-microsoft-magic-goat1.jpg" alt="">
<img src="/img/2011-10-18-microsoft-magic-goat2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In fact, even a line of text such as &ldquo;hhhh hhh hhh hhhhh&rdquo; will elicit
the same results.</p>
<p>However, some character strings that fit the &ldquo;4,3,3,5&rdquo; pattern <em><strong>do
not</strong></em> generate the error.
For example, the phrase &ldquo;Bush hid the truth&rdquo;
is displayed normally. However, conspiracy theorists should not take
this as aiding their argument. &ldquo;Fred led the brats&rdquo;, &ldquo;brad ate the
trees&rdquo; and other strings also escape the error.</p>
<p>Thus, any hint of political conspiracy fades into oblivion and is
replaced by a rather mundane programming bug. It seems that a certain
combination and/or frequency of letters in the character string cause
Notepad to misinterpret the encoding of the file when it is re-opened.
If the file is originally saved as &ldquo;Unicode&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;ANSI&rdquo; the text
displays correctly. Older versions of Notepad such as those that came
with Windows 95, 98 or ME do not include Unicode support so the error
does not occur.</p>
<p><strong>MAGIC #3</strong><br>
Using the rand() function in the way described automatically adds sample
text to a word document. In Word 2003 and earlier versions, the rand()
function adds several sentences and paragraphs that repeat the words,
<em>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</em>. These words are often
used for testing because, together, they contain all the letters in the
English alphabet in one concise and coherent sentence. Such a sentence
is known as a pangram.</p>
<p>In Word 2007, the rand() function adds information about using specific
Word features in order to create a more realistic document for testing.
However, if you wish to use the &ldquo;Quick Brown Fox&rdquo; pangram in Word 2007,
you can still do so by inputting the function =rand.old(). Another Word
2007 option is to use =lorem(), This function automatically adds the
familiar <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lorem ipsum</a> dummy text that has been used by the printing and typesetting industry
since the 1500&rsquo;s. Nowadays, Lorem ipsum text is also used extensively by
web developers and publishers to add random text to such things as
templates and website prototypes.</p>
<p>You can alter the results of the rand() function by adding numbers in
the round brackets. The first number controls the number of paragraphs
while the second number controls the number of sentences in each
paragraph. For example, using &ldquo;rand(3,5)&rdquo; will add three paragraphs of
five sentences each. Leaving the brackets empty will add the default
number of paragraphs and sentences, which is set at three sentences and
three paragraphs.</p>
<p>Far from being a mystery, this is a well-documented feature of Microsoft
Word that simply allows sample text to be quickly added to a document
for testing purposes. Microsoft can in fact &ldquo;explain the result&rdquo; and
does so in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3Ben-us%3B212251"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article on the MS Support website</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, although these little computer tricks are interesting, there is no
mystery or magic involved and Microsoft certainly does know about
them.</p>
