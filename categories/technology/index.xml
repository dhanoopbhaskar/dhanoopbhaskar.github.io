      <description>The Google is introducing its new project named Project Loon to overcome the terrestrial challenges to Internet connectivity such as jungles, archipelagos, mountains, etc.
It is nothing but balloon-powered Internet access. A ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, provides Internet access to the earth below. These balloons are carried by the wind at altitudes twice as high as commercial planes and they beam Internet access to the ground at speeds similar to today’s 3G networks or faster.</description>

      <description>There are many utilities in Linux/Unix which are very useful in our life say for example sed, awk, grep, etc. Some of us might have wished Windows/DOS environment to have similar kind of utilities. Anyway I did. Today I came across some of the open source projects, while googling, which provide some of the utilities in Windows too and thought of sharing :)
The projects are GnuWin and UnxUtils.
Please find below the links to their sourceforge pages GnuWin UnxUtils  </description>
